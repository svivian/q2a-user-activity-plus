Question2Answer plugin

This is a page plugin for popular open source Q&A platform, Question2Answer <question2answer.org>. It adds the functionality to show every question and answer of a user.

Both lists include the class `qa-a-count-selected` where applicable for appropriate styling of selected answers.
